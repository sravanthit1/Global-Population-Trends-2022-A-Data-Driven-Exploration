# Global-Population-Trends-2022-A-Data-Driven-Exploration
# 🌍 World Population in 2022

### 📝 Introduction

The objective of this data visualization project is to analyze and visualize population dynamics across different countries using a comprehensive dataset for the year 2022. The dataset includes various demographic factors such as population size, yearly population change, net change, population density, median age, net migration, fertility rate, urban population percentage, and world share.

Through this project, we aim to compare and examine population characteristics and demographic indicators across countries. The visualizations and statistical analyses provide insights into population size, land area, population density, median age, net migration, fertility rate, and growth trends.

### 🌐 Domain of Dataset

- **Population Statistics and Demographic Indicators**

### 📊 Dataset

- **Name**: World Population 2022
- **Source**: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmadjalalmasood123/world-population-dataset)
- **Number of Records**: 235
- **Number of Columns**: 12

### 📋 Columns

1. **#**: Ranking of country based on population
2. **Country (or dependency)**: Name of the country or dependency
3. **Population (2022)**: Estimated population in 2022
4. **Yearly change**: Percentage change in population from the previous year
5. **Net change**: Net change in population (births - deaths + net migration)
6. **Density (P/Km²)**: Population density per square kilometer
7. **Land Area (Km²)**: Total land area in square kilometers
8. **Migrants (net)**: Net migration rate
9. **Fert. Rate**: Fertility rate (children born per woman)
10. **Med.Age**: Median age of the population
11. **Urban Pop %**: Percentage of the population living in urban areas
12. **World Share**: Percentage of the global population represented by each country

### 🛠️ Visualization Tools Used

- **Tableau** 📈
- **Excel** 📊

### 🧹 Data Cleaning Strategies

- Replaced blanks and NA values in the Migrants, Fert Rate, Med.Age, and Urban Pop columns with 0.
- Used Tableau Prep for data cleaning and added necessary steps to handle missing values.

### 🎯 Goals of the Project

1. **Compare Population Sizes**: Visualize and compare the population sizes of various countries in 2022.
2. **Land Area and Net Change**: Show the land area and net change for the top five most populated countries.
3. **Population Density Analysis**: Analyze and compare population density across countries.
4. **Median Age and Net Migration**: Examine the relationship between median age and net migration for each country.
5. **Population Density and Fertility Rate**: Analyze the relationship between population density and fertility rate for the top 10 countries.
6. **Urban Population Comparison**: Compare the urban population percentages across different countries.

### 🏁 Conclusion

This project has provided valuable insights into global population dynamics and demographic indicators for 2022. Through extensive visualizations and analyses, we have gained a comprehensive understanding of population sizes, land areas, net changes, population density, median age, net migration, fertility rates, and urban population percentages.

While this project lays the groundwork for understanding global population trends, further research could delve deeper into specific aspects of demographic indicators and incorporate additional data sources for more refined analysis.

### 🚀 Future Work

- **Extended Analysis**: Explore additional demographic factors and trends.
- **Data Expansion**: Incorporate more recent data or additional datasets for broader insights.
- **Methodological Refinement**: Enhance analytical methodologies and visualization techniques.
